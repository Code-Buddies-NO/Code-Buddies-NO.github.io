                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                <p>Code Buddies Hub began as a creative experiment between two friends, Lennert and Dennis. What started as a way to combat boredom turned into an exciting journey of collaboration and learning. We wanted to challenge ourselves by creating a chat platform while exploring the possibilities of working together remotely.</p>
